      <h1>Cool stuff I've built</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Chad Norvell, and here's a selection of things I've
      built that I think are particularly neat.</p>

        <h2>New operating systems powering millions of shipped products</h2>
        <p>At Google, I work on <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/">Fuchsia</a> and
        <a href="https://pigweed.dev">Pigweed,</a> two products pushing the
        state-of-the-art in operating system design. They power millions of
        devices and have brought tangible benefits to the product development
        process.</p>
        <p>My focus has been developer experience, and I've been proud to ship
        greenfield development tools that elicit responses like this from their
        users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"This is a complete game-changer"</li>
          <li>"You have no idea what a difference this is going to make for
          us"</li>
          <li>"Once you use it, you don't know how you lived without it
          before"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I founded Pigweed's developer relations team, and my engagement with
        the open-source community has led to Pigweed being deployed on <a

        <h2>A full-stack IoT platform for off-grid energy</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.angaza.com/">Angaza</a> makes life-changing
        products accessible and affordable to people in emerging markets, even
        those who live on less than $2 per day. With affordable access to
        livelihood necessities like <a href="https://sunking.com/">solar
        lights</a> and <a href="https://www.atecglobal.io/">clean
        cookstoves</a>, people without access to credit or traditional banking
        services can start on a path to financial inclusion.</p>
        <img src="images/angaza1.jpg" />
        <p>I led the development of an IoT platform for off-grid solar energy
        products deployed in over 50 countries, providing clean energy to more
        than 2 million people. This work was truly full-stack&mdash;we built:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>microcontroller firmware for low-power devices</li>
          <li>robust backend infrastructure</li>
          <li>web and mobile applications running on a wide variety of
          devices</li>
          <li>data engineering pipelines ingesting information from devices in
          some of the least-connected parts of the world</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I propsed and developed industry standards for the off-grid energy
        industry that were <a
        href="https://www.gogla.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gogla_whitepaper_the-connect-initiative_def.pdf">adopted
        in 2021</a>. This dramatically increased access to the energy ladder throughout the developing world by
        introducing compatibility and interoperability between devices across the industry.

        <h2>The world's first comprehensive post-disaster national building
        assessment</h2> 
        <p>Immediately after Hurricanes <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma">Irma</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria">Maria</a> struck
        the Caribbean in 2017, I worked with the United Nations and the World
        Bank to ensure that reconstruction would be resilient against future
        disasters.</p>
        <p>In partnership with <a
        href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/custom-microsoft-app-helping-caribbean-rebuild-hurricanes/">Microsoft</a>,
        we built <a
        href="https://www.undp.org/barbados/news/innovation-post-disaster-data-collection-caribbean-world">mobile
        and web applications</a> for geospatial data collection and analysis,
        with two challenges:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The apps had to go live in a matter of days</li>
          <li>We couldn't count on having a consistent internet connection or
          power, either in the field or at HQ, and the data that came in each
          day immediately impacted recovery resource allocation the next
          day.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the end, we achieved 100% coverage of each country we worked in, a
        first for the industry.  The results played a crucial role in revising
        regional building codes to build resilience against future disasters,
        and directly supported the island nation of <a

        first climate-resilient nation</a>. Since then, the technology has

        <h2>Rapid, safe, affordable housing in India</h2>
        <p>WorldHaus was a social enterprise incubated at <a
        href="https://idealab.com/">IdeaLab</a> to develop radically affordable
        housing products for families in India. We developed low‐cost,
        high‐speed home building systems, reducing the cost of construction by
        up to 30% and bringing safe, high quality housing in reach of thousands
        of families.</p>
        <p>I was brought on as the founding engineer, and had to turn an idea
        ("what if we could capture the world's largest unserved housing
        market?") into reality&mdash;houses!</p>
        <p>The key challenge: how do you fundamentally change the process of
        building while still creating houses that people <em>want</em> to live
        in?</p>
        <img src="images/worldhaus1.jpg" />
        <p>My solution, in summary:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A modular building system that could be constructed rapidly with
          unskilled labor</li>
          <li>The use of natural materials available locally, to reduce the
          cost, delay, and environmental impact of transporting materials long
          distances</li>
          <li>Strategic use of pre-fabricated materials to minimize costly and
          time-consuming concrete work</li>
          <li>Architectural styles and features that felt familiar and
          delightful to our customers in rural villages and urban slums</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Did it work? <strong>Yes.</strong> We built houses that were better
        than the market standard for 30% less than market rates, and we provided
        safe housing to thousands.</p>

        <h2>Fixing a life-support system on the International Space Station</h2>
        <p>On the ISS, a mass spectrometer is used to monitor air composition
        and ensure that the air the astronauts breathe is safe. That air must be
        heated before analysis, which is accomplished with a halogen bulb. That
        bulb failed 10 times faster in space than it did on Earth, and for some
        reason, NASA hired a group of undergraduate engineering students to
        figure out why.</p>
          <p>We got to test our theory in real microgravity, produced by running our experiment on NASA's reduced-gravity aircraft, or "vomit comet".</p>
          <p>While my colleagues built a test apparatus, I wrote computer vision
          software that used <a
          href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bsuther/papers/procsorrento0998/reprint_style.pdf">synthetic
          schlieren photography</a> to visualize and quantify the convective
          flow of air around the bulb in Earth's gravity and in
          microgravity.</p>
          <p>The prognosis? Put a fan on the bulb.</p>
